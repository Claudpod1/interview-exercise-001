## SETUP
1. Clone this repo to your local environment
Fork the assignment onto my github. 
Then used a "git clone" from the fork on my github. 

2. Create a work branch for yourself

Created the branch in the UI for GitHub.
Then used git checkout in the terminal. 
Followed by git add -A , git commit -m, git push --set-upstream origin Claudi_Branch_JavaScript.

3. Create a new file called NOTES.md to write down anything you learn, have questions about, or think is worth otherwise noting as you go along!

Completed. 

4. Commit your file to your local branch and push it to the origin repository.
Pushed.

Assignment started at 7:12pm Sunday November 6, 2022. 


## FIRST RUN
1. Create whatever file structure you need for your language of choice to be able to run a simple command line app. 

Javascript will be used. 

2. Update the command line app to print the basic "Hello world!" to stdout.

Done in the console.log for the script.js

3. Commit your changes to your local branch and push them to the origin repository.



## OK, SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING!
1. Update your command line app to pull random data from random-data-api.com (https://random-data-api.com/documentation)

Googled for some examples regarding the time restriction. 
Link to one I have found helpful.

* The idea I had in mind was to create a table using the tablemanager to display the 10 user names that are mentioned in this youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k5kUJEf1Wk. 

Then using the straegy from the second youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gD2gY2YjgyE

2. Pull 10 users. Print out the username and title for each to stdout.

- Able to console.log data. 

3. Pull 100 blood_types.  Count the number of entries in group "A+" and print to stdout.
4. Commit your changes to your local branch and push them to the origin repository.


* Cons 

Not enough time. 
Was able to console log the data from the api but not display on the screen. 


* Pros 
Had fun doing this assignment. 
Sticked to the time limit. 
Documented my steps.


Overall: 

I was able to start the project, and get to engine rolling on a game plan. Console.log as much as I could to ensure I was receiving the correct information from the API. I bit rusky on the coding but overall enjoyed the time spend on it.
